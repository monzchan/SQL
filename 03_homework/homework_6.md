**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

I have been working in the hospital as a nurse for over 6 years and I have encounted quite a lot of ethical dilema.

For example, there was a patient approaching me to ask about the update on her lab report regrading a specimen sent at the date of operation. As a nurse working in the specialty clinic, I was able to access to all patient's information as long as the patient was an active out-patient at our clinic. However, I was not the nurse in charge of that patient and I was not involved in the operation that day, so it might not be ethical to retrieve data from a patient out of my scope of care. Therefore, I only explained to her about the situation and the ethical issues, and direct her to ask about information from her family doctor.

Another example would be my co-worker being admitted for an operation, and I was a nurse involved in the care that day. As a case nurse, I was authorized to retrieve patient's data about the patient's conditions such as her medical history, family backgrund, current medical conditions, and current medication etc, so as to provide patient-centered care. However, there was always an issue abut how much a nurse should know about that patient. As this patient was admitted for a minor procedure, namely the suturing of a laceration. Retrieving data about whether or not she has medication allergy, diabetic condition for wound healing should be enough to determine the care to be provided. Other data such as her family history, marital status, psychological consultation etc may not be significant. This example is brought up to stress on the importance of defining the boundary of data retrieval for the purpose of action.
